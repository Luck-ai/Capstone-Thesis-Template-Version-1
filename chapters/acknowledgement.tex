\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}

Acknowledgement refers to an announcement of appreciation for virtue. It
specifically acknowledges the goodness of individuals who provided assistance leading
to the successful completion of research, a thesis, or an academic report. During the
process of conducting research, a thesis, or academic work, individuals may receive
assistance, guidance, or support that contributes to the successful completion of the
task. In recognition of this aid and in gratitude, individuals express their appreciation
by writing a Certificate of Appreciation, which is included at the beginning of the
research, thesis, or academic work. This serves to demonstrate satisfaction and
heartfelt gratitude for the goodness of those who assisted. In essence, a Certificate of
Appreciation is a declaration of gratitude.

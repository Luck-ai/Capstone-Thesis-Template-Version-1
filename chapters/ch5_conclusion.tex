\chapter{BIBLIOGRAPHY AND REFERENCES}

The writing of a bibliography or references should adhere to one system that aligns with the chosen citation method. Use 'Bibliography' when citing in-text with the name-year system and use 'References' when citing in-text with the numerical sequence system. The use of bibliography management software, such as Endnote, Mendeley, Zotero, etc., is permitted and encouraged.

\section{GUIDELINES FOR WRITING BIBLIOGRAPHY}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Print the word Bibliography in the center of the page in bold, size 24 points.
    \item Arrange the entire reference list together, alphabetically based on the first letter of each reference, following the alphabetical order as per the dictionary.
    \item For theses written in Thai, list the bibliography in the Thai language first, followed by the English language bibliography. For theses written in English, list the English language bibliography first, followed by the Thai language bibliography.
    \item Begin printing the bibliography at the left edge of the paper. If the entry does not fit on one line, start a new line indented by 7-character spaces. Begin printing the 8th character if the entry extends to the second line. If not completed within two lines, continue onto lines 3-4 starting from the same position as line 2 until the end of the entry. When starting a new entry, align it with the left edge of the paper without skipping a line.
\end{enumerate}

\section{GUIDELINES FOR WRITING REFERENCES}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Print the word References in the center of the page in bold, size 24 points.
    \item Arrange the reference documents in numerical order, according to the numbers assigned within parentheses referring to the content of the thesis.
    \item There is no need to separate by language or document type.
    \item Print the number of each entry at the left edge of the paper. If the entry does not fit on one line, start a new line indented by 7-character spaces. Begin printing the 8th character if the entry extends to the second line. When starting a new entry, align it with the left edge of the paper without skipping a line.
\end{enumerate}

\section{METHOD OF LISTING BIBLIOGRAPHY}

\subsection{Authors}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The author's name should not include any titles such as Mr., Mrs., Miss, Dr., etc.
    \item For entries in the Thai language, use the author's first name followed by the last name.
    \item For entries in English, use the last name, followed by a comma and the abbreviated first and middle names in sequence.
    \item If the author holds a doctorate (Ph.D.), professorship, or other title, include it after the name, separated by a comma.
    \item Use the name as it appears in the document for authors with honorific titles.
    \item If there are two authors, use the name of the first author followed by and between the names of the two authors.
    \item If there are more than two authors, list all authors.
    \item For authors using pseudonyms, use the pseudonym as it appears in the document.
    \item For translated documents, list the name of the translator first, followed by the phrase "translated from" and the original author's name. If the original title is unknown, use the phrase "translated by" or "translated and compiled by."
    \item For documents attributed to an organization, ministry, or department, use the name of the organization as the author. In the case of documents issued under a specific department within a ministry or subordinate to a department, even if the ministry's name is mentioned, use the department's name as the author. Include the name of the subordinate unit in the publisher section.
    \item For documents with only an editor or compiler, use the editor's name followed by a comma and the word editor or compiler after the name of the author.
    \item For documents with no stated author or conference proceedings, use the title of the document as the first entry.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Article Titles}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the title as it appears in the document, enclosed in quotation marks.
    \item For English titles, capitalize the initial letter of each word, except for conjunctions, articles, and prepositions, unless they are the first word.
    \item If there is a scientific name in Latin for plants, animals, etc., insert it in \textit{italics} or \underline{underline} it.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Book or Journal Titles}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Print book or journal titles in bold.
    \item For international journals, you may use the correct abbreviation of the journal name.
    \item For book series, if referencing a specific volume, include only that volume. For example, if referring to volume 3, and if citing multiple non-consecutive volumes, indicate each volume number with commas in between, such as Volume 1, 3, 5. If citing all volumes in the series, state the total number of volumes, such as 5 volumes or 5 vol. Underline or print in bold (either one) continuously from the title.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Editions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For the first edition or first printing, it is not necessary to specify in the bibliography.
    \item Specify the edition number for subsequent editions, as indicated in the printed material. For example, 2nd Ed., 2nd printing, 2nd, rev. ed., or 2nd, expanded ed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Place of Publication and Publisher}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For Thai-language references, include the name of the province as the place of publication. For Bangkok, use the term Bangkok.
    \item If the publisher has offices in multiple cities and the names of those cities appear in the document, use the first city mentioned as the place of publication.
    \item List the publisher's name without including terms like Publisher, Company Limited, "Publisher," "Co---Inc.," or "Co..Ltd."
    \item If the document does not mention the publisher's name, list the name of the printing house with the term Printing House.
    \item For publishers associated with universities or organizations, provide the full name, such as Thammasat University Press.
    \item If the printer is a government or private organization, use the organization's name as the publisher.
    \item If the name of the person responsible for printing is not stated, use 'n.p.' (no place of publishing) in English.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Year of Publication}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Include the year of publication in numeric format, as it appears in the document.
    \item If the publication year is not mentioned, use 'n.d.' (no date) in English.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example of Bibliography Format}

The specifications for referencing in the bibliography format are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Variables in different listings, such as author, day, month, year, and publisher, should use the regular Courier PC format.
    \item Variables that need to be printed in bold should use the Courier Upright Bold format.
    \item Terms that need to be printed in italics, such as 'ผู้แปล' (translator) or 'โดย' (by), should use the regular Arial Unicode MS format.
    \item Replace single-letter spacing with the '/' symbol.
    \item In cases where a single line is not sufficient, start the second line with the eighth character, leaving a space of 7 characters.
    \item Other symbols such as '.', ',', " ", :, -, [ ], should be printed as specified.
\end{enumerate}
